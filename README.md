# Covid_19_Prediction EDA Machine Learning
 In today's world, where the global community continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of accurate and efficient tools for disease prediction has become increasingly crucial. In line with this need, our proposal aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is COVID-19 positive or not based on a dataset of symptoms. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy and speed of COVID-19 diagnosis, thereby contributing to effective medical treatment and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
